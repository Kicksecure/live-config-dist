# A branding component is a directory, either in
# SHARE/calamares/branding or in /etc/calamares/branding
# (the latter takes precedence). The directory must contain a
# YAML file branding.desc which may reference additional resources
# (such as images) as paths relative to the current directory.
# Only the name of the branding component (directory) should be
# specified here, Calamares then takes care of finding it and
# loading the contents.
branding: Kicksecure

# If this is set to true, Calamares will show an "Are you sure?" prompt right
# before each execution phase, i.e. at points of no return. If this is set to
# false, no prompt is shown. Default is false.
#
# YAML: boolean.
prompt-install: false

# If this is set to true, Calamares will execute all target environment
# commands in the current environment, without chroot. This setting should
# only be used when setting up Calamares as a post-install configuration tool,
# as opposed to a full operating system installer.
#
# Some official Calamares modules are not expected to function with this
# setting. (e.g. partitioning seems like a bad idea, since that is expected to
# have been done already)
#
# Default is false (for a normal installer).
#
# YAML: boolean.
dont-chroot: false

# If this is set to true, Calamares refers to itself as a "setup program"
# rather than an "installer". Defaults to the value of dont-chroot, but
# Calamares will complain if this is not explicitly set.
oem-setup: false

# If this is set to true, the "Cancel" button will be disabled entirely.
# The button is also hidden from view.
#
# This can be useful if when e.g. Calamares is used as a post-install
# configuration tool and you require the user to go through all the
# configuration steps.
#
# Default is false, but Calamares will complain if this is not explicitly set.
#
# YAML: boolean.
disable-cancel: false

# If this is set to true, the "Cancel" button will be disabled once
# you start the 'Installation', meaning there won't be a way to cancel
# the Installation until it has finished or installation has failed.
#
# Default is false, but Calamares will complain if this is not explicitly set.
#
# YAML: boolean.
disable-cancel-during-exec: false

# If this is set to true, then once the end of the sequence has
# been reached, the quit (done) button is clicked automatically
# and Calamares will close. Default is false: the user will see
# that the end of installation has been reached, and that things are ok.

quit-at-end: false
